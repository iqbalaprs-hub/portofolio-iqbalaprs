            a web application helps you organize your everyday life. It helps
            you sort your goals by organizing your to-do-list into sections: (1)
            “today” for tasks you aim to accomplish today, (2) “tomorrow” for
            tasks you want to do the next day, (3) “later” for tasks you want to
            do during any other day, and (4) “Done” for completed achievements.

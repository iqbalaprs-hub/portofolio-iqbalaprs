          <p>
            All tests were executed manually and run using Cypress. The
            Twitter-Clone application was tested on Chrome (if needed by the
            client, they can also be tested in other browsers).<br />Here's
            below, the results of running "npx cypress run --browser chrome".<br />Using
            Cypress and manual tests, I detected a number of bugs in the
            Twitter-Clone application. The next section lists those bugs.

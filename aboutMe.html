        <h3>Web-designer and developper</h3>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and dedicate website developer. I am very excited to
          be a web developer and to create visually stunning and responsive
          websites with fast load times, positive user interface and being
          responsive on any device, big or small.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a self-taught motivated individual, I have spent countless hours
          learning and practicing the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
          to build a strong foundation for my skills and gain a keen eye for
          details and a quick problem-solving skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am constantly expanding by staying up to date with the latest web
          development trends and techniques, and I am exploring new technologies
          and frameworks that can enhance the functionality and aesthetics of
          the websites I create.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I create a website, I produce prototypes. These prototypes will
          enable clients to experience how a user interface will feel before it
          is coded. This will give the opportunity for them to decide on the
          design and provide feedback at an early stage and be part of the
          iteration process, so I will be able to implement the website in a
          short amount of time with more efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being a website developer is not just a job, it is also something that
          I enjoy. I also have a strong work ethic and a passion for continuous
          learning. I am always willing to improve myself because my goal is to
          create a web that is fast, easy and excited to use and navigate,
          pleasing, accessible to all (special needs people included) and
          frustration-free.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a 100% commitment to make your website the best it can possibly
          be with fresh energy and passion and the ability to understand your
          business and your needs.
